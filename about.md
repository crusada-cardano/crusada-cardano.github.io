<h3>Operation</h3>
<br>
Crusada is a **Voluntary Association** run by **Cardano SPOs**. 
We exist and operate as a **Private GitHub Organisation**, founded in late October 2023.
<h3>Scope</h3>
<br>
Our goals are to **defend Cardano's Decentralisation** and **demand integrity and transparency from Cardano's founding entities**. We will pursue these goals by engaging with the **Cardano Community** through articles, forum discussion, videos and other relevant materials. 
<h3>Joining Us</h3>
<br>
Thank you for taking interest in **Crusada**. If you would like to join our cause, please drop us a line <a href="mailto:recruit@crusada.io">here</a> with your **Mainnet Pool ID or Ticker** and your **GitHub Handle**. We shall be in contact shortly to send you a **GitHub Invitation**.
